# Stone-Paper-Scissor
The "Stone Paper Scissors" game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is an engaging web application where players can compete against a computer opponent. The game interface features buttons for the player to select their choice of "Stone," "Paper," or "Scissors." Upon making a selection, the computer randomly generates its choice. JavaScript functions then determine the winner based on the classic rules of the game: stone crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers stone. The outcome is displayed on the interface along with the updated scores. CSS styling enhances the visual appeal of the game, making it intuitive and enjoyable to play. With its simple yet captivating design, this project provides an excellent opportunity to practice front-end development skills while having fun playing a timeless game.
